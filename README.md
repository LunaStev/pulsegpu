# 🌊 PulseGPU: A GPU-Centric Framework for Extreme Parallelism

PulseGPU is a new kind of GPU execution framework and DSL (Domain-Specific Language),
designed to push parallel processing to its absolute limit—on the GPU, not the CPU.

## Core Philosophy:
* ✅ GPU-first computation model—not CPU-driven

* ✅ Intuitive gpu_parallel! macro syntax for writing parallel logic

* ✅ More control and freedom than CUDA or OpenCL

* ✅ Implemented using Vulkan → vendor-independent

* ✅ Gives developers full control over performance, memory, and threading

### Minimal Syntax Example:
```rust
gpu_parallel!(
    threads = 65536,
    block = 256,
    i, {
        output[i] = input1[i] + input2[i];
    }
);
```

## Design Goals:

| Feature       | Description                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture  | Rust-based DSL with a Vulkan compute backend                                        |
| Performance   | Low-level optimization, shared memory, and warp-level control                       |
| Extensibility | Planned support for CUDA, Metal, and WebGPU backends                                |
| Integration   | Native to Rust, but FFI-compatible with C and Python                                |
| Philosophy    | Built on the belief that “The most powerful tools are the ones you build yourself.” |
